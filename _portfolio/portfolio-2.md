Through the 2024-2025 academic year, I was in a team of 17 members to design, analyse, and build a blended wing-body UAV drone. My personal role was that of the Systems Engineer, with many responsibilities in this interdisciplinary team. Core responsibilities and contributions include: 
* MLG and NLG design, analysis, and validation
* Steering mechanism design and implentation for the NLG
* Control surface integration and actuation
* Assisted heavily with CatiaV5 modelling, including leading the outer mold line reconstruction of the BWB UAV
* Mapping module selection and integration

I will be updating this portfolio item with more discussion on specific solutions found, analyses, and quantifiable results in the future.
