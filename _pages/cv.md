Education
======
* B.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering, Carleton University, Expected December 2025

Work experience
======
* May 2025 - Present: Sales Consultant
  SAIL Ottawa
  * Conveyed technical product knowledge to a clientele of varying expertise enabling quick identification of customer needs

* May 2025 - Present: Research Assistant  
  Aerospace Structures and Materials Engineering (ASME) Lab, Carleton University
  * Implemented high-speed dynamic digital image correlation (DIC) techniques using GOM Correlate to validate the modal response of an aluminum wing specimen subjected to impulse loading
  * Evaluated multiple rigid mounting configuration for a fixed-free boundary condition, identifying and implementing a T-bar clamp solution that minimized unwanted vibration
  * Developed MATLAB scripts to process voltage-time data from the oscilloscope using a Fast Fourier Transform for efficient frequency domain verification and to determine the temporal and spatial noise floor to validate the authenticity of high frequency modes
  * Supervisor: Professor Mostafa El Sayed

* May 2023 - August 2024: Industrial Manufacturing Engineering Coop  
  Collins Aerospace (RTX), Oakville, Ontario
  * Designed new tooling which were modelled and drawn in Catia V5 for assembly processes increasing the rate of production and reducing part downtime
  * Implemented the Power Platform suite of tools including Power Apps, Power BI, and Power Automate to optimize the transfer of production data improving response time to tool maintenance and inspections
  * Streamlined the creation of 3D work instructions by systematically identifying individual tooling and production line assemblies with no Catia models and modeling them
  * Co-led a site-wide lean manufacturing initiative to align tool management policies with actual workflow and upcoming third-party software implementation
  * Contributed to revised policies and earned RTX CORE Champion designation for leadership in process improvement

* Spring and Fall 2023: Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) Facilitator  
  Center for Student Academic Support, Carleton University, Ottawa
  * Design, prepare for, and execute two 80-minutes workshops per week that summarize course content and teach it to students in a fun, engaging, and collaborative way 
  * Received one week of formal training regarding teaching strategies, communication skills, and professionalism to ensure students can be supported well through their course 

* Summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022: Production Operator  
  Continental Conveyor, Napanee, Ontario
  * Assembled high precision parts as specified by engineering drawings to meet client orders by deadlines
  * Worked individually and as a team to assemble conveyor rolls for bulk materials handling equipment, to be used in various mines, quarries, and other industries worldwide.
  * Optimized productivity by taking note of which method and order of assembly was the most efficient when working with large order jobs and allowed production to move faster than expected
